# Password-Cracker-BruteForce-Approch
n given a hash of exactly five character password.
The valid characters used in this password are a-z, A-Z and 0-9. Five characters thus yields
over several million possibilities. 
We are going to use a brute force and ignorance approach to finding
this password — in other words, we are going to try all possibilities.
A main controller thread is responsible for distributing work to an arbitrary number of worker threads. This may be done in any
manner chosen by you.
The program should terminate immediately after finding the pass-word; do not continue processing oryou will get an inaccurate indication 
of the required processing time.
Input: I have given you a midterm.cpp file which has the n given a hash of exactly five character
password. The valid characters used in this password are a-z, A-Z and 0-9. Five characters thus yields
over several million possibilities. We are going to use a brute force and ignorance approach to finding
this password — in other words, we are going to try all possibilities. A main controller thread is
responsible for distributing work to an arbitrary number of worker threads. This may be done in any

The program should terminate immediately after finding the pass-word; do not continue processing or
you will get an inaccurate indication of the required processing time.
