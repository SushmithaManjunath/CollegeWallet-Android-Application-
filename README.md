# CollegeWallet-Android-Application-
 mobile based smart cashless system
A College Wallette aims to be designed as a mobile (preferably android) application that allows an individual to make cashless transactions. This can include making payments like library dues, exam fee, canteen bills, hostel bills using a smartphone. Increasingly, college wallets can be used not just for basic financial transactions but also to authenticate the students' credentials. One can approach the term college wallet not as a singular technology but as three major parts: the system (the database), the application (the software that operates on top) and the device (the smartphone)
